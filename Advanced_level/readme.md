# 🎵 Spotify Tracks Data Analysis (Advanced Level - ShadowFox Internship)

Welcome to my data science project, where I conducted a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Spotify Tracks Dataset using Python in Jupyter Notebook.

This project is part of the **Advanced Level Task** for the **ShadowFox Data Science Internship**.

---

## 📁 Dataset Source

The dataset was taken from [Kaggle - Spotify Tracks Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maharshipandya/-spotify-tracks-dataset), containing audio features and metadata for thousands of tracks available on Spotify.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Perform thorough EDA to understand audio features, popularity trends, and genre distributions.
- Visualize patterns and correlations between track features like energy, danceability, and popularity.
- Answer key research questions and interpret results using plots and data summaries.

---

## ❓ Research Questions Answered

1. What is the overall distribution of song popularity on Spotify?
2. How do features like danceability and energy relate to a song’s popularity?
3. Which genres are most common in the dataset?
4. Which genres tend to have the highest average popularity?
5. Is there any noticeable trend between tempo and popularity?
6. What are the top 10 most popular songs in this dataset?

## 📊 Visualizations Used

- Popularity Distribution Histogram
- Danceability vs Energy Scatter Plot (colored by popularity)
- Top 10 Genres by Track Count
- Top 10 Genres by Average Popularity
- Tempo vs Popularity Scatter Plot
- Table of Top 10 Most Popular Songs
- Correlation Heatmap

## 🧠 Tools & Technologies

- Python 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook 📒 (in VS Code)
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

---

## 📌 Key Insights

- Most songs are moderately popular (popularity score between 40–70).
- High energy and danceability positively correlate with popularity.
- Pop, dance pop, and hip hop are the most common and most popular genres.
- Tempo doesn't significantly influence a song's popularity.
