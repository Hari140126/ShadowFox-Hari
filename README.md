# ShadowFox Data Science Internship (June 2025)

This repository contains the work I completed during a 1-month virtual Data Science internship with ShadowFox. The internship was divided into three structured levels – Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced – each involving hands-on tasks using Python and real-world datasets. I performed data preprocessing, visualization, and generated insights using industry-standard tools.
