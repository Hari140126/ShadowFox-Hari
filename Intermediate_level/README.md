# Delhi AQI Data Analysis Project 🏙️

This is a data analysis mini project for my Data Science Internship (Intermediate level) at ShadowFox.

## 📌 Objective

Analyze Delhi’s air pollution data using Python and visualize insights such as:

- PM2.5 levels over time
- Monthly pollution patterns
- Dominant pollutants
- Correlations between pollutant levels

## 📁 Files Included

- aqi_analysis.ipynb – Jupyter Notebook with full analysis
- delhiaqi.csv – Dataset used for the project
- README.md – Summary of project (this file)

## 🧾 Project Summary

This mini-project is part of my Intermediate Level Internship under ShadowFox – Data Science Track.

The project focuses on analyzing Delhi's air pollution using real-world data containing various pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, and others.

I used Python and libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn in Jupyter Notebook to:

- Clean and prepare the dataset
- Convert date columns into usable format
- Extract month and year for seasonal trends
- Visualize the rise and fall of pollution over time
- Explore the relationship between pollutants

Through this analysis, I found that:

- PM2.5 is the most dominant pollutant in Delhi
- Winter months (November to January) consistently show the worst air quality
- PM2.5 and PM10 show a strong correlation, likely due to similar sources (vehicles, construction, etc.)

This project helped me improve my skills in:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization using matplotlib and seaborn
- Understanding real environmental datasets

## 📊 Research Questions & Key Insights

1. How does PM2.5 change over time?
   - High pollution in winter months (Nov–Jan)

2. Which months are most polluted?
   - November, December, January

3. Dominant pollutants?
   - PM2.5, PM10, NO2

4. Correlations?
   - PM2.5 has strong correlation with PM10 and NO2

5. Seasonal Effect?
   - Winter is the most affected season

## 🔧 Tools Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib

## 📌 Proof of Work

This is part of my intermediate level submission under the ShadowFox Internship Program.
